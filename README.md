## Upcomming/Planned Development:
 - Charge to ollie, holding `B` will cause sprite to bend down and bounce higher on release of `B`
 - Flip tricks `B`+`Direction` (Kickflip/Treflip/hardflip etc - number of tricks is restricted by animation and control limitation of the GameBoy)
 - Nollie
 - Improved Soundeffects (Pop/Landing/Rolling/Grinding)
 - Lofi/Hip-Hop Music/themetune
 - Grind Mechanics (previous demo had a grind mecanic using lots of triggers suttounding an object)
