# Grind_Boy
Hombrew Skateboarding platformer game for the Nintendo GameBoy.
Built with [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/). 

GB studio is used to manage assets/scenes/menus and modifying the C engine governs the actual mechanics.

To Play the Latest Demo V 1.1:
The latest Demo is a simple stripped back version of the game with no obstacles being used to test/fine-tune the controls and animations.

## Upcoming/Planned Development:
 - Fix menu redering issue, due to sprite animation over the limit
 - Jump charging animation
 - Flip tricks `B`+`Direction` (Kickflip/Treflip/hardflip etc - number of tricks is restricted by animation and control limitation of the GameBoy)
 - Nollie
 - Improved Soundeffects (Pop/Landing/Rolling/Grinding)
 - Lofi/Hip-Hop Music/Themetune
 - Grind Mechanics (previous demo had a grind mecanic using lots of triggers suttounding an object)
